//Given a number n, find count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
//The anwer can be very large. So, you have to return answer modulo 109+7.
Approach:- in this problem ,just like two boxes , n and n .we had to check both side no. of ones/zeroes.for that we use the mathematiical formula of combinatiion 
Ncr=(n+1-r/r)*Nc(r-1). We swuare this for getting the ans because it every place we can store either 1 or 0 ,so total possibilities will be square of this.
class Solution
{
    public int  compute_value(int n)
    {
        // code here
        long ans=1;
        long mod=1000000007;
        long c=1;
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            c=((((n+1-i)*c)%mod)*((1/i)))%mod;
            long temp=(ans*ans)%mod;
            ans=(ans+temp)%mod;
        }
        return (int)ans;
    }
}
